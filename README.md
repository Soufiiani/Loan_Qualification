## Overview
This project builds an end-to-end workflow to determine whether an individual qualifies for a loan based on account information. It includes:
- Data prep & feature engineering
- Model training and export to a portable pipeline (`loan_pipeline.pkl`)
- An interactive Streamlit front-end for single-case scoring

## Compare models steps
- Fill missing value with KNN Impputer
- Normalize our data
- Fit our data with LogisticRegression, KNN, and ANN models
- Compare model's accuracy with scaled and non-scaled data
- Use GridsearchCV models (Decision Tree/RandomForestClassifier/GradientBoostingClassifier/...)
- After all, compare the best models

## Create Application
Use RandomForestClassifier model to predict loan status in application
**Two Types of Data should be enter by user:**
- Categorical
- Numerical
